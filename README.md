# GRTeclyn and MHDuet
### Numerical Relativity with AMReX

This repository contains the code to generate the slides for my presentation
about [GRTeclyn](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRTeclyn) and 
[MHDuet](http://mhduet.liu.edu/) delivered by Miren Radia at the [Gregynog
Numerical Relativity 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/nrgregynog) meeting on
Wed 18 June 2025.

## Quarto

These slides are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown in the
[Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.

### Build

To generate the slides, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
and then execute

```
quarto render slides.qmd
```

It should generate a `slides.html` file which you can open with a web browser.

### GitHub Pages

I will publish the slides to the GitHub pages site associated to this
repository.
