# GRChombo and GRTeclyn
### New Frontiers in NR 2025 Panel discussion

This repository contains the code to generate the slides for a short
presentation introducing
[GRChombo](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRChombo) and
[GRTeclyn](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRTeclyn) delivered by Miren
Radia as part of a panel discussion on numerical relativity codes at the [New
Frontiers in Numerical Relativity 2025](https://grg.uib.es/newfrontiersNR25/)
conference at the University of the Balearic Islands on Wednesday 23 July 2025.

## Quarto

These slides are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown in the
[Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.

### Build

To generate the slides, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
and then execute

```
quarto render slides.qmd
```

It should generate a `slides.html` file which you can open with a web browser.

### GitHub Pages

I will publish the slides to the GitHub pages site associated to this
repository.
